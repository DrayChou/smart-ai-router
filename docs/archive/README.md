### 📁 completed-reports/
Implementation and evaluation reports for completed work:
- `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` - Multi-API compatibility completion
- `IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` - General implementation status
- `OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - Performance optimization summaries
- `COMPREHENSIVE_PROJECT_EVALUATION.md` - Project evaluation analysis

## Archive Policy

Documents are archived when they become:
- **Obsolete**: Describe systems/concepts no longer in use
- **Completed**: Implementation reports for finished work
- **Theoretical**: Proposals not being actively pursued
- **Legacy**: Historical documentation preserved for reference

## Current Active Documentation

See the main `docs/` directory for current, relevant documentation about the system's tag-based routing architecture and YAML-first configuration approach.
